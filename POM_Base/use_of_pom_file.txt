#Benefits of Using POM
=>Encapsulation: Test logic is separated from UI element details.
=>Reusability: POM files can be reused across multiple tests.
=>Maintainability: If the UI changes, you only update locators in the POM file, not all test cases.
=>Clarity: Test cases become cleaner and more readable.

#Checklist for POM Files
=>Locators: Define all necessary locators using appropriate strategies (ID, XPath, CSS Selectors).
=>Methods: Include methods for actions and verifications on the page.
=>Encapsulation: Avoid hardcoding data directly into methods; use test data files or parameterized inputs.
=>Structure: Organize POM files by web pages or logical components.
